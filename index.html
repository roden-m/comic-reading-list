              In a league of its own. The prose is a lot more sophisticated than
              any other comics I've read. A small detail I liked is the
              transitions like the ones into flashbacks. Only drawback is that I
              don't like such a heap of cynicism without hope. However,
              objectivebly speaking, this is a real masterpiece.

              Incredible character work. Dr Manhattan is cold and distant, only
              caring for Laurie. His power is so otherworldly it alienates him
              from humans. Dr Manhattan is a god-man who regards human matters
              as insignificant. But should absolute power always alienate? The
              rich ruler is definintely separated from the needs of the common
              man. Politicans today are critiqued of being out of touch at
              times. But unlike Dr Manhattan, the God-man that is Jesus shows
              its possible to be almighty but also Emmanuel and El Roi.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rorshach is another great character. You follow his slow descent
              into becoming a violent vigilante. But you still root for him
              because of his sad back story and the fact that he is active about
              injustice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Laurie strikes me as a character that doesn't know herself well.
              She gets into the superhero stuff because of her mum and she
              resbounds into the relationship with Danny.

          Does a great job of slowly escalating to a crescendo. Modern comics
          are so trivial with action scenes, but the build this was done well as
          well as the pay off. The leadership of Superman raised a lot of
          questions on how to lead well. Also does a great job in showing the
          issues that arise in enforcing the law, how much force do you use?
          What do you do with a superhero gone rogue?

          One of the first comics i read. This and Runaways. This is a real

          when JJ Jameson finally recognised Spiderman as the hero he is.

          Coming of age. What do you do when your parents, the people that you
          are supposed to be safe with, turn out to be villains? This was one of
          the first comics I read. I identified with the complicated
          relationship with parents. Though my parents are a lot better than
          supervillains of course.

          always live in their shadow? Or will they forge their own path? Do

          A story about division, about superheroes being held accountable. It's
          not abundatly clearly who you should side with. More and more unity is
          becoming more of a personal value to me, so a story like this
          definitely resonates with me. A tragedy occuring and the legislative
          response and debate that ensues, mirrors a myriad of real life events.
          Raises important questions like how can you reconcile and both get
          what you want? How do you resolve a conflict that has become so
          pervasive? The sudden escalation to violence is often the fruit of
          division. The constant shifting of allegiances is a good device to
          show how tricky the moral dilema is. Spiderman is a key part in Tony's
          plan, then even he switches sides. Even Sue Richards switches sides.

          interacts with the world in a unique way, through sonar. He has a
          profession outside of the superhero gig. In every battle, his every
          move is calculated. As a lawyer he defends people who need the help.
          There's a lot to like about the character. This has been a great entry

          Zod showed up out of nowhere and sent Supes to the Phantom Zone.
          Wrecked him. The idea of the Phantom Zone, a place where time stops is
          something real scary. Another child (Chris/Lord-Zod) appearing out of
          the woodworks felt a bit on the nose, but with that being said, it was
          an interesting dynamic, Superman immediately drawn to protecting him
          as he was once that kid. A really great, beginner friendly read for
          Superman. Brainaic has very clear motives. His intention to capture
          socities, shrink them, and leech them of their knowledge is very
          fitting of a super villain.

          When it was revealed that the ‘Nevermind’ had infected Mikey that
          really surprised me and motivated me to read on. One of the themes is
          that destiny has flexibility. It makes you question who is the good
          guy here? The supposed good people make decisions that sacrifice
          lives. But Mikey has the ‘Nevermind’ corrupting him, so he couldn’t
          possibly be good. Changing sides, and the tension of who is on what
          side is a theme. The prospect of Terrenos leaking into earth always
          looms over you. The art on the full-page spreads is awesome.

          Awesome story about not being ashamed of who you are. The little girl
          and Superman’s story parallels. The little girl ashamed of her Asian
          heritage, Superman ashamed of being an alien. But they both come to
          accept who they really are. They both embrace what makes them
          different which unlocks new power for them. For Superman his
          superpowers are fully released, for the little girl, she gains new
          courage.

          My first Hickman comic! Wahoo! Crosses over into Sci-Fi territory with
          the different timelines and advanced technology. Complicated story,
          even the island itself has lore. The many lives of Moira are very
          interesting. Introduces Krakoa, a mutant promised land. Interesting
          that Charles would give up the idea of co-habitation. Resurrecting
          mutants by combining the powers of several mutants was crazy. Art
          really suits the story. Landscape of Krakoa is awesome.

          Story would be rated a bit higher, but it’s only three issues. The
          plot twist is of him being alone is really good. Really shows how he
          has lost his grip on reality.

          Loved the concept of only using red and blue. Some classic art, some
          modern art. Some stories I really liked, some stories didn’t leave an
          impression. Too many stories to comment on.
